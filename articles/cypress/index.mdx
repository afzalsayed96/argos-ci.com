Automated visual testing enables developers to detect and resolve visual issues within applications ahead of time. This approach ensures that any alterations or updates made to web applications maintain the intended appearance and functionality.

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to implement visual testing automation using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Our objective is to configure a system that alerts us of any visual alterations with each pull request on GitHub, enabling us to correct visual defects before they are deployed to the production environment.

## Sign up to Argos

To kickstart your journey with Argos, initiate the process by [signing up](https://app.argos-ci.com/signup) on the Argos platform. Post sign-up, you have the convenience to import a new project directly from GitHub or GitLab, seamlessly integrating your repository with Argos. With your project imported, you're now poised to set up Argos within your codebase, paving the way for automated visual regression testing as an integrated part of your development pipeline.

## Cypress and Argos setup

[Cypress](https://cypress.io) is a robust and modern end-to-end testing framework designed to provide developers with a reliable, fast, and intuitive testing environment for web applications. It enables the automation of browser-based tests, ensuring the functionality and consistency of applications across different browsers and platforms, while offering real-time feedback, automatic waiting, and easy debugging capabilities.

To install Cypress, first add the dependency:

```sh
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

And launch it with:

```sh
npx cypress open
```

Starting from Cypress version 10 onwards, we have the capability to craft both End-to-End (E2E) and component tests. Our focus will be exclusively on E2E testing.

Next, Cypress will display a list of various files it will create to ensure everything is correctly configured for e2e testing. Click on the "Continue" button at the bottom to proceed.

Click on the "E2E Testing" button on the left to dive in.

To use Playwright with Argos, you will also have to install the following packages:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/cli  @argos-ci/playwright
```

- [@argos-ci/cli](https://argos-ci.com/docs/argos-cli): easiest and fastest way to upload screenshots to the Argos.
- [@argos-ci/playwright](https://argos-ci.com/docs/playwright): improve screenshot stability and expose CSS to hide content.

### Configure Argos Reporter

The Argos reporter seamlessly uploads test screenshots to Argos in real-time.

Install reporter in your Playwright config:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

// "list" is the default reporter, if you use any other, don't forget to add it back
const defaultReporters: PlaywrightTestConfig["reporter"] = [["list"]];

export default defineConfig({
  // ... other configuration

  // Add Argos reporter only when it runs on CI
  reporter: process.env.CI
    ? [...defaultReporters, ["@argos-ci/playwright/reporter"]]
    : defaultReporters,
});
```

## Capture the screenshots

Once Playwright and Argos app are installed, you can create test files to capture screenshots of your application. Use the `argosScreenshot` function provided by `@argos-ci/playwright` insure stable screenshots.

For example, the following test file will take a screenshot of your homepage:

```js
// tests/homepage.spec.ts
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/playwright";
import { test } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("Homepage", () => {
  test("take screenshot", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("http://localhost:3000/");
    await argosScreenshot(page, "homepage");
  });
});
```

To run the test, use the playwright test command:

```sh
npx playwright test
```

If everything is set up correctly, the test should pass, on the CI screenshots will be uploaded to Argos.

## Integrate with GitHub Actions

With the screenshots captured, you can now integrate the Visual Testing into your GitHub Actions Continuous Integration. To do this, you have to create a new GitHub Actions workflow file that runs Playwright tests and uploads screenshots to Argos.

Create a new file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` in the root directory of your repository with the following content:

```yml
# file: .github/workflows/main.yml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npm exec playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm exec playwright test
```

This workflow defines a job that runs on pull requests to the main branch. The job does the following:

- Checkout the code from GitHub
- Setup Node.js
- Install dependencies
- Install Playwright browsers
- Run the tests with Playwright and upload screenshots to Argos

Once you have added the workflow file, you can commit and push the changes to your repository. GitHub will automatically start running the workflow on each pull request.

## Monitor Visual Changes

You can now start monitoring visual changes in your web application. Argos will detect and report any visual changes between your pull request branch and your `main` branch.

**GitHub check status**

By clicking on "Details" link, you can review the results of the comparison in Argos.

Read [this documentation](https://argos-ci.com/docs/visual-testing) if you need more information about visual testing workflow.

## Bonus: Capturing Screenshots on Test Failures

Playwright's [recording options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options#recording-options) facilitate the automated capture of screenshots upon test failures. Notably, these captured screenshots are then automatically uploaded to Argos.

```ts
// playwright.config.{js,ts}
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    // Setting to capture screenshot only when a test fails.
    screenshot: "only-on-failure",
  },
});
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have shown you how to automate visual testing with Playwright, Argos, and GitHub Actions. By integrating visual testing into your CI workflow, you can catch and fix visual bugs before they make it into production. With Argos, you can easily configure baseline, monitor visual changes, and collaborate with your team to fix issues. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can be sure that your web application looks and functions as intended, even as you make changes and updates.
